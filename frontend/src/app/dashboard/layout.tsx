 * Persistent chrome for every `/dashboard/*` route.

 * A layout is not re-rendered when navigating between routes that share it, so
 * hoisting the auth gate and console shell here keeps the sidebar mounted
 * across navigation. Previously each page rendered its own `ConsoleShell`
 * (directly, or via `InstitutionConsolePage`), so every sidebar click unmounted
 * and rebuilt the whole shell — the sidebar briefly vanished and returned as a
 * new DOM node, which looked like a full page reload.
 *
 * `ProtectedRoute` is intentionally not given `allowedRoles` here: the
 * dashboard is shared by institutions and students, and the individual routes
 * keep their own role checks.

 * The signing seam (ACREDIA-STELLAR#3).

 * the key is a different concern, and welding the two together cost three
 * things:
 *
 *  - `invokeContractMethod` could not be unit-tested without stubbing a
 *    browser extension, so `contracts.test.ts` could only reach the pure
 *    helpers around it.
 *  - The E2E path worked around it with a `getE2eState()` branch inside every
 *    exported function — six early returns that re-implemented authorization
 *    checks and token-id sequencing purely to avoid reaching a signer.
 *  - Server-side signing (a keeper, a relayer, an institution's backend) was
 *    impossible without editing the module.
 *
 * A signer is the whole dependency: an address, and the ability to sign. Note
 * what is *not* here — no connect, no disconnect, no wallet metadata. Those
 * belong to the wallet layer (`src/lib/wallet/`); a signer is what you hand to
 * something that needs a signature.

 * The single E2E seam for on-chain work (ACREDIA-STELLAR#3).
 *
 * `contracts.ts` used to carry six separate `getE2eState()` early returns —
 * one inside every exported function. Each re-implemented the business logic it
 * was bypassing (authorization checks, token-id sequencing), purely so the
 * browser suite never reached a wallet. That is two copies of the rules, and
 * only one of them was the real one.
 *
 * Everything E2E-specific now lives here, behind two seams:
 *
 *  - {@link createE2eSigner} — a signer for the four *writing* functions. The
 *    fake signs nothing and submits nothing; it records what it was asked to do
 *    and returns the hash the suite expects.
 *  - {@link e2eLedgerReads} — the two *read-only* functions
 *    (`getContractOwner`, `isAuthorizedIssuer`) never sign, so a signer is the
 *    wrong tool. They ask this instead.
 *
 * Authorization is decided in exactly one place ({@link isAuthorizedInE2eState})
 * rather than three, so the fake ledger can no longer disagree with itself.
